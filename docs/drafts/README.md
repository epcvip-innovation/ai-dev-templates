# Drafts

Work-in-progress documentation that isn't ready for "production" workflows yet.

**Purpose**: Explore and refine ideas before promoting to main templates/docs.

**Workflow**:
1. Create draft in this folder
2. Iterate and refine based on real usage
3. When validated, move to appropriate location in `templates/` or `docs/`
4. Delete or archive the draft

## Current Drafts

| Draft | Status | Target Location |
|-------|--------|-----------------|
| [MCP-DECISION-TREES.md](./MCP-DECISION-TREES.md) | In Progress | `docs/reference/` or `templates/` |

## Draft Status Definitions

- **In Progress**: Actively being developed
- **Under Review**: Ready for testing/validation
- **Ready to Promote**: Validated, needs to be moved to final location
- **Archived**: Didn't work out, kept for reference
