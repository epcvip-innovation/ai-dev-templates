# Railway Configuration - Python FastAPI with SQLite (RAILPACK)
# Modern builder with 77% smaller images and better caching
#
# Usage:
# 1. Copy to your project root as railway.toml
# 2. Set DATABASE_PATH env var: railway variables set DATABASE_PATH=/app/data/your_db.sqlite
# 3. Use --workers 1 for SQLite (required to prevent database locking)
# 4. Commit and push to deploy

[build]
builder = "RAILPACK"

[deploy]
# IMPORTANT: --workers 1 required for SQLite to prevent locking
startCommand = "uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT --log-level info --workers 1"

# Health check endpoint (must return 200 OK)
healthcheckPath = "/health"
healthcheckTimeout = 120  # Longer timeout for database initialization

# Restart policy (RAILPACK uses uppercase)
restartPolicyType = "ON_FAILURE"
restartPolicyMaxRetries = 3

# Persistent volume for database (data persists across deployments)
[[deploy.volumeMounts]]
mountPath = "/app/data"

# Required environment variables (set via Railway CLI or dashboard):
# DATABASE_PATH=/app/data/your_db.sqlite
