# Claude QA Review Workflow
#
# Automated PR verification using Claude Code with Playwright MCP.
# Uses the official anthropics/claude-code-action@v1 for browser-based QA.
#
# Triggers:
# - Automatically on file path changes (configure paths below)
# - Manually when 'qa-verify' label is added
#
# Setup:
# 1. Add ANTHROPIC_API_KEY secret to repository
# 2. Configure paths to match your app structure
# 3. Customize the prompt for your app's features
#
# Based on: https://alexop.dev/posts/building_ai_qa_engineer_claude_code_playwright/
