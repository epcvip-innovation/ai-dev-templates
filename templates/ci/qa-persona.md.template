   - Check for console errors
4. Try relevant edge cases based on the changes
5. Take screenshots of any issues found
6. Produce a verification report in the format above

### Tool Usage

You have access to Playwright MCP browser tools. Use them to:
- `browser_navigate` - Go to pages
- `browser_snapshot` - See the current state (Claude receives accessibility tree + screenshot)
- `browser_click` - Interact with elements
- `browser_type` - Enter text
- `browser_take_screenshot` - Capture evidence

Focus on **black-box testing** - test what the user sees, not implementation details.

## Severity Guide

- **Critical**: App crashes, data loss, security issue
- **High**: Feature completely broken, blocking workflow
- **Medium**: Feature partially broken, workaround exists
- **Low**: Cosmetic issue, minor inconvenience
