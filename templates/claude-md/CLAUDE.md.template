# CLAUDE.md

<!-- This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository. -->

<!--
TARGET LENGTH: 150-200 lines maximum (official guidance: 100-200)
PHILOSOPHY: Reference, don't embed. Keep lightweight, link to detailed docs.
RULE: No section should exceed 30 lines. If it does, extract to separate doc.
-->

## Project Purpose

<!--
WHAT BELONGS: 5-15 lines answering "What is this project? Why does it exist?"
WHEN TO EXPAND: Never. If you need more, create PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md
EXAMPLE: "This is a [type] for [purpose]. It's designed to [key value prop]."
-->

[Replace with 2-3 sentence description of your project]

---

## Tech Stack

<!--
WHAT BELONGS: List only (5-10 lines). Brief explanation if framework is unusual.
DON'T INCLUDE: Installation instructions, detailed setup (goes in README or SETUP.md)
EXAMPLE: "- React 19 - UI framework with TypeScript"
-->

- **[Framework/Language]** - [One-line description]
- **[Key Tool]** - [One-line description]
- **[Library]** - [One-line description]

---

## Critical Warnings & Gotchas

<!--
WHAT BELONGS: Project-specific quirks that Claude frequently gets wrong.
CRITERIA: Does Claude make this mistake without explicit guidance? Include it.
EXAMPLES:
  - Tailwind v4 vs v3 (new tech, Claude trained on old version)
  - Deprecated patterns that look correct but break
  - Environment-specific requirements
WHEN TO SKIP: Standard best practices Claude already knows
MAX LENGTH: 30 lines. If more, extract to CONFIGURATION_GUIDE.md
-->

### [Critical Configuration or Pattern]

**DO:**
- ✅ [Correct approach]
- ✅ [What works in this project]

**DON'T:**
- ❌ [Common mistake Claude makes]
- ❌ [Deprecated pattern that looks right]

<!--
If you have 3+ critical warnings, create separate CONFIGURATION_GUIDE.md
Keep only the top 1-2 most frequent mistakes here.
-->

---

## Common Development Commands

<!--
WHAT BELONGS: 5-10 essential commands used in 80%+ of sessions
FORMAT: Command + one-line description
DON'T INCLUDE:
  - Rarely-used commands (put in DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md)
  - Deployment commands (unless you deploy multiple times per day)
  - Setup/installation (goes in README)
-->

```bash
[command]  # Description
[command]  # Description
[command]  # Description
```

---

## Code Patterns & Conventions

<!--
WHAT BELONGS: Project-specific patterns Claude needs to follow
CRITERIA:
  - Used in 80%+ of files
  - Unique to this project (not general best practices)
  - Claude gets it wrong without guidance
MAX LENGTH: 20 lines
IF LONGER: Create CODING_STANDARDS.md, link to it here
-->

### [Pattern Category]

**Example:**
```[language]
// Good - project pattern
[code example]

// Bad - what Claude might suggest instead
[code example]
```

**Reference**: See [CODING_STANDARDS.md](./CODING_STANDARDS.md) for complete guidelines

<!--
IMPORTANT: Do NOT embed full coding standards here.
3-5 lines showing most critical pattern + link to full standards doc.
-->

---

## Domain Knowledge (Optional)

<!--
INCLUDE ONLY IF: Your project has domain-specific concepts that Claude can't infer
CRITERIA: Would a new developer need to learn this to contribute?
MAX LENGTH: 15 lines (brief summary only)
IF DOMAIN IS COMPLEX: Create DOMAIN_GUIDE.md, put 3-line summary here
EXAMPLE: "This project works with statistical testing. Key terms: EPL, redirect rate, sample size."
-->

**Key Concepts** (brief):
- **[Term]**: [One-sentence definition]
- **[Term]**: [One-sentence definition]

**Reference**: See [DOMAIN_GUIDE.md](./docs/DOMAIN_GUIDE.md) for detailed explanations

<!--
If you find yourself writing formulas, long explanations, or tutorials: STOP.
Move to separate doc, keep only 2-3 line summary here.
-->

---

## Environment & Configuration (Optional)

<!--
INCLUDE ONLY IF: You have environment-specific requirements Claude needs for EVERY session
WHAT BELONGS: Critical env vars, deployment context, database connections
DON'T INCLUDE: Full setup instructions (goes in README or SETUP.md)
MAX LENGTH: 15 lines
-->

**Essential Environment Variables:**
```bash
[VAR_NAME]  # Required for [purpose]
[VAR_NAME]  # Required for [purpose]
```

**Reference**: See [SETUP.md](./SETUP.md) for complete environment setup

---

## File Organization

<!--
INCLUDE ONLY IF: Your project structure is non-standard or confusing
WHAT BELONGS: 5-10 line directory tree of key locations
DON'T INCLUDE: Full file tree (Claude can explore with glob/grep)
EXAMPLE: "src/ contains components, utils/ contains helpers"
-->

```
key-directory/   # [Purpose]
another-dir/     # [Purpose]
```

---

## Documentation Map

<!--
ALWAYS INCLUDE: This is how you keep CLAUDE.md lightweight
PURPOSE: Guide Claude to the right detailed doc for specific needs
FORMAT: Category → File → When to use it
-->

**For coding standards**: [CODING_STANDARDS.md](./CODING_STANDARDS.md)
**For setup/installation**: [README.md](./README.md) or [SETUP.md](./SETUP.md)
**For domain knowledge**: [DOMAIN_GUIDE.md](./docs/DOMAIN_GUIDE.md)
**For deployment**: [DEPLOYMENT.md](./docs/DEPLOYMENT.md)
**For project planning**: [backlog/](./backlog/)

<!--
This is the most important section for keeping CLAUDE.md lean.
Every time you're tempted to add 50 lines of detail, ask:
"Could this be a separate doc with a 1-line reference instead?"
-->

---

## Development Notes (Optional)

<!--
WHAT BELONGS: High-level principles, workflow tips
MAX LENGTH: 15 lines
EXAMPLES: "This is a template, keep it lightweight" or "HMR is fast, no need to refresh"
-->

### [Development Principle or Note]

[2-3 sentences about how to work effectively in this project]

---

## Quality Checklist (Optional)

<!--
INCLUDE ONLY IF: You have a short checklist that should run before commits/PRs
MAX LENGTH: 10 lines
IF LONGER: Create QUALITY_CHECKLIST.md or use /ai-review slash command instead
-->

Before committing:
- [ ] [Essential check]
- [ ] [Essential check]
- [ ] [Essential check]

==============================================================================
FINAL REMINDERS FOR KEEPING THIS FILE LIGHTWEIGHT
==============================================================================

1. TARGET: 150-200 lines total (you're reading guidance comments, final should be much shorter)
2. EACH SECTION: Maximum 30 lines. If longer, extract to separate doc.
3. REFERENCE > EMBED: Always prefer linking to detailed docs over including detail here
4. QUARTERLY AUDIT: Run /audit-claude-md to detect bloat accumulation
5. ASK: "Is this needed in 80%+ of sessions?" If no, move to separate doc.

COMMON BLOAT SOURCES TO AVOID:
❌ Embedding full coding standards (use 3-line summary + link)
❌ Long lists of commands (keep 5-10 essential, link to full list)
❌ Domain tutorials (brief summary + link to guide)
❌ Setup instructions (belongs in README)
❌ Deployment procedures (belongs in DEPLOYMENT.md)
❌ File trees (Claude can explore, only list key 3-5 directories)
❌ "Just in case" information (if it's not used regularly, delete it)

GOOD SIGNS:
✅ Most sections are 5-15 lines
✅ Multiple "Reference: [doc]" links
✅ Concrete examples (not prose explanations)
✅ You can read the entire file in 2-3 minutes
✅ It answers "what is this?" and "what do I need to know?" without bloat
